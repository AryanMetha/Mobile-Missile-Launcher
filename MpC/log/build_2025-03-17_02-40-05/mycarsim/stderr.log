[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findignition-msgs7.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ignition-msgs7", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ignition-msgs7"
  with any of the following names:

    ignition-msgs7Config.cmake
    ignition-msgs7-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ignition-msgs7" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ignition-msgs7_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ignition-msgs7" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
